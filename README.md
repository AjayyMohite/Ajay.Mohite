👋 **About Me**

Hi there! I'm a passionate **Manual Test Engineer** with over **10+ years** of experience ensuring software quality through detailed testing strategies and keen attention to detail. Recently, I've been diving deep into the world of Data Analysis, exploring how data-driven insights can drive better decisions and strategies.

🔍 I'm currently upskilling with projects in:

• **Excel Dashboards

• Python for Data Analysis

• SQL for data querying

• Power BI for data visualization**

📊 One of my recent projects involved building a **Sales Analysis Dashboard** in Excel to showcase key metrics and trends — now featured in my portfolio.

🌱 I'm open to collaborations, **learning opportunities, and data-focused roles** where I can bring my analytical mindset and quality-focused background together.
